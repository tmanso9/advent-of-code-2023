# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions in JavaScript for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges.
Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th.

## Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's `solution.js` containing the code for both parts of the corresponding puzzle. Additionally, you'll find the input files required for each day's challenge.

|-- day-01  
| |-- input.txt  
| |-- solution.js  
|-- day-02  
| |-- input.txt  
| |-- solution.js  
|-- ...  

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the day's folder, e.g., `day-01`.
2. Open a terminal in that folder.
3. Run the solution script:
   ```bash
   node solution.js

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Contributing
